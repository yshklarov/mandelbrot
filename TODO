- Fix bug: redraw_delayed resets delay to its initial value, not to the newly given value
- Multiprocessing for rendering (see cpu_count? process pool?)
- File -> Copy location... (popup with 4 values as a tuple, "Copy to clipboard", "Close), Go to location...,
- Switch to ctr/zoom instead of four bounds; always keep 1:1 aspect ratio (by screen dimensions, not pixel count)
- Arbitrary precision/zooming
- Iteration adjustment: View->Set Maximum Iterations...
- Viewport dragging (without redrawing the whole canvas)
- Help->About
- On zoom or resize, stretch old Surface instead of filling with black
- Fix flickering due to frame getting redrawn during resize (maybe use a tk Canvas with an image instead of a pygame Surface)
- Progressive rendering
- "Automatic" max iterations feature
- Make color gradient dynamically configurable
- Make a GPU implementation
- Resize Surface to fit frame (it should work if the window is larger than the physical display)
- Switching between Mandelbrot and Julia sets
- Internal coloring
