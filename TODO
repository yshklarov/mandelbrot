- Iteration adjustment: View->Set Maximum Iterations...
- Don't redraw whole canvas when dragging viewport
- "Automatic" max iterations feature (check if escaped at last iteration in more than 1% of screen)
- Use C for worker/mandelbrot code
  - eg. pass in: center pos'n, zoom level, relative position (two floats between -0.5 and +0.5). Returns: an integer (number of iterations).
- Arbitrary precision/zooming (keep it fast: use machine precision for low zoom)
- On zoom or resize, stretch old viewport instead of filling with black
  - Move away from tkinter (since Frames get re-painted when resized): eg. use GTK
- Always keep 1:1 aspect ratio (by screen dimensions, not pixel count)
- Show cursor location in status bar
- Make color gradient dynamically configurable
- Make a GPU implementation
- Formula editing: allow Julia sets, etc
- Internal coloring
- Antialiasing
