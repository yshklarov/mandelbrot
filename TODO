- Improve progressive rendering: both dimensions; and fill with squares and not lines (don't leave black space)
- Viewport dragging (without redrawing the whole canvas)
- Arbitrary precision/zooming
- Iteration adjustment: View->Set Maximum Iterations...
- Show cursor loc'n in status bar
- Always keep 1:1 aspect ratio (by screen dimensions, not pixel count)
- On zoom or resize, stretch old Surface instead of filling with black
- Fix flickering/blackness due to frame getting redrawn during resize (maybe use a tk Canvas with an image instead of a pygame Surface)
- "Automatic" max iterations feature
- Make color gradient dynamically configurable
- Make a GPU implementation
- Resize Surface to fit frame (it should work if the window is larger than the physical display)
- Formula editing: allow Julia sets
- Internal coloring
